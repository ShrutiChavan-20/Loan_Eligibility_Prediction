Loan Eligibility Prediction - Machine Learning Project. This project focuses on building a Loan Eligibility Prediction model using Python and Machine Learning. The objective is to predict whether a loan should be approved based on the applicant's information.

Objective: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and key features, Identify and preprocess features relevant to Loan_Status (Approved/Not Approved), Build a predictive model using ML algorithms, Evaluate and optimize the model for best accuracy.

Dataset: loan-train.csv: Used for training the model, loan-test.csv: Used for testing the model.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for Data Visualization), Scikit-learn (for Machine Learning Models).

Algorithms Applied: Decision Tree Classification, Navie Bayes.

Outcome: A machine learning model capable of predicting whether a loan application is eligible or not, based on historical training data.
